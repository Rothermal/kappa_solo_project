This Application is a repairs tracker for any automotive repairs I do for friends and family. 
I built the application using the SEAN stack, postgrSql Express Angular Node. I used angular materials for styling and a local authentication strategy thru passport.

you can either register your own name or login to the heroku app with the simple login of username : 1 password : 1.

all the repairs are editable, you can add customers, vehicles, repairs or parts.
