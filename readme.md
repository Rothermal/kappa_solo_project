This Application is a repairs tracker for any automotive repairs I do for friends and family. 
I built the application using PostgreSql Express Angular Node. I used angular materials for styling and a local authentication strategy thru passport.


all the repairs are editable, you can add customers, vehicles, repairs or parts.
